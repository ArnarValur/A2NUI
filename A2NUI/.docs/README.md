## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set your Gemini API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY

# Run the playground
NUXT_PORT=3003 pnpm dev

# Open http://localhost:3003/playground
```

## What is A2UI?

A2UI (Agent-to-UI) is a JSONL-based streaming protocol that allows AI models to generate platform-agnostic UI definitions. Instead of returning markdown or HTML, the AI returns structured component descriptions that get rendered using the host platform's native widget set.

**Key insight**: The AI doesn't need to know about CSS, Tailwind, or Nuxt UI internals. It just says "give me a Text with variant h2" and the renderer handles the rest.

## Session History

- **2026-02-13**: Initial implementation — processor, renderer, 11 catalog components, Gemini API integration, playground with Chat/Paste/Inspect tabs. Full end-to-end streaming working.
