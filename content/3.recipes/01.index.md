# Recipes

Pre-composed A2UI patterns that demonstrate how **AI Agents** build real-world interfaces from standard catalog components.

Each recipe shows the **JSONL payload** an AI agent would stream, the **live rendering**, and the **design rationale** behind the composition. Use these as templates when teaching your own agents to generate A2UI.
